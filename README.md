<h3 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned & Continued Development</h3>

I used this project to further develop my understanding of CSS grid, CSS layout, and mobile-first methodology. This is my first project using CSS grid and mobile-first methodology without a tutorial. I intend to use mobile-first methodology in future projects. In following projects I need to plan out the CSS grid in all device sizes before starting the styling.
